# Enerval App Project

This app's intention is to track your energy consumption throughout a contract year to be able to be aware of recent changes in your personal energy usage on a monthly or even weekly base instead of just seeing your overall consumption compared to the excepted one at the end of a contract year in the final invoice.

Everyone who occasionally wants to see if his household's consumption of energy sways throughout the year can use the app. All they need to do is passing over their most current meter reading and the app will do the rest.

There will be a landing page where you can pass over the latest meter reading. Then there'll be a bunch of analytics using past meter readings. Such as oscillations in your monthly consumption or aggregated into quarters for seasonal differences. You can enter the data of your current energy contract in order to be aware whether your monthly advance payment will correspond your consumption.
